There are three separate storage areas to fulfil several needs within the system. First I have a 22,000 litre rainwater/treated water polythene storage tank. Second there are 7 X 200 litre polythene drums which are interconnected to give an effective capacity of 900 litres. Lastly is a 55000 litre reinforced concrete in-ground swimming pool which has been converted to become a fish pond. This also has a buffer storage capacity of 6000 litres.
