There are three separate water storage areas to fulfil several needs within the system. 

First I have a 22,500 litre rainwater/treated water polythene Rainwater Storage Tank. The tank is connected directly to several roof areas for rainwater harvesting and also to the pressure pump reticulation system to allow filling with treated water. A pressure pump is also connected to the tank discharge to allow water reticulation and water transfer as required.

Second there are 7 X 200 litre polythene drums (Treated Water Tanks) which are interconnected to give an effective capacity of 900 litres. Another pressure pump is also connected to the tank dischage to allow water reticulation and water transfer as required. 

Lastly is a 55000 litre reinforced concrete in-ground swimming pool (the Pond) which has been converted to become a fish pond. This also has a buffer storage capacity of approximately 6000 litres. Water is removed from the pond as required indirectly via redirecting it to a Slow Sand Filter and UV treatment system prior to being stored in the Treated Water Tanks.
