There are six separate solids recovery streams which neeed to be dealt with. 

* **Shadehouse Swirl and Bio-Filtration solids**
* **Pump Area Swirl and Bio-Filtration solids**
* **Pump Area Sand Filtration backwash solids**
* **Lower Pond Bio-Filtration solids**
* **Activated sludge solids**
* **Lower Pond to Shadehouse Flooded Pipe**

The system which allows me to filter out the solids and recover the filtrate consists of 6x200L polythene drums which are linked by 25mm drum connectors to allow first settling then filtration and finally automated and controlled pumping to retreat the filtrate.

Each 'batch' consists of around 400L of sludge/water liquor which is held to settle out for up to 12 hours depending on its settleability.
In most cases 95% of solids have settled in 3-4 hours but I usually allow around 6-8 hours for up to 98% to settle.

At that time the settled liquor is allowed to rune into the 4th and 5th drum where a fine stainless stell mesh filter covered in white polythene filter material cleans out most remaining sludge particles. 

The clear liquor (or Solids Filtrate) is then pumped to my storm water sump in a controlled manner whereby pumping stops at high level in the storm water sump.
This then is forwarded to the grey water sump as the treatment system is able to handle intake.

I usually takes around 4-6 hours for the 400L of Solids Filtrate to be run into the Treatment System depending on any other inflows at the time.
