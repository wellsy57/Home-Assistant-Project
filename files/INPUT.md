There are three Input Sumps designed to harvest, contain and control input streams entering the Treatment System or those being returned for further treatment.

* **Grey Water Sump** The Grey Water Sump is installed adjacent the bathroom and laundry to allow both these streams to be harvested to them to be pumped to the treatment system. The sump is fitted with a sump pump and high/low level sensors which have proven themselves to be 100% reliable given adequate maintenance. The pump is a 25mm discharge, Davey 'dirty water' type stainless steel pump. The sensor type is the same pressure switches as those used in clothes washing machines and dish washers for level control. I have designed my own bubble trap to be be more robust and have easier adjustment means to allow accurate level control from a mounting point at the top of the sump.

Maintenance simply requires a regular visual inspection of the sump pump, pressure switch, tubing, fittings etc. I check for any debris buildup and carry out a thorough cleaning if required. I also test operation is at the required liquid levels.
