## Irrigation Control
Irrigation Control was really where it all began for my personal interest in automation.
Things started out quite simply with off the shelf controllers and 13mm solenoids for a fairly basic system however my passion for growing plants took hold and my needs became much greater.

These days I have scaled back on the propagation of plants and really only need two areas with automated watering so my Home-Assistant UI reflects that.



As I have recently migrated my monitoring and control system from a SCADA system I will also share a couple of (now retired) mySCADA UI screenshots to give you an idea of what the existing PLC program can do if required.

Not terribly long ago there were three irrigation areas and two misting areas.
