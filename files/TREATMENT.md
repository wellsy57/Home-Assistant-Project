There are quite few separate processes which go together to provide a SAFE AND RELIABLE source of non-potable rain harvested and recycled water supply. 

## Input
Input to the system comes from several areas outside the system but also as return streams within the system.
* **DIRECT RAIN HARVESTING** All areas of main house roof which can be directly captured in gutters and diverted to the 22,500L main storage tank have been. Remaining main house roof areas run to the street with future plans to capture and transfer to the tank. The garage roof is 100% captured in gutters and diverted to the 55,000L fish pond. The top 200mm of the pond is used as a buffer storage for short term storage and treatment purposes.
* **INDIRECT RAIN HARVESTING** I have installed a substantial stormwater piping system which is designed to capture and direct all rain which falls to ground within my house block and direct it to my storm water sump. An automated pump then transfers that water to my grey water sump which in turn automatically transfers the water to be treated by the treatment system.
* **Irrigation and washdown runoff harvesting** My shadehouse, garden areas and concrete areas have been designed to drain into my stormwater system which is retreated.
* **Solids removal filtrate** Treatment and filtration produces high nutient solids waste which is filtered and removed to compost heaps or pumped to sewer if not able to handle quantity.
