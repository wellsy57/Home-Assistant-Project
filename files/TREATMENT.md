There are quite few separate processes which go together to provide a SAFE AND RELIABLE source of non-potable rain harvested and recycled water supply. 

## Input
Input to the system comes from several areas outside the system but also as return streams within the system.
* **DIRECT RAIN HARVESTING** All areas of main house roof which can be directly captured in gutters and diverted to the 22,500L main storage tank have been. Remaining main house roof areas run to the street with future plans to capture and transfer to the tank. The garage roof is 100% captured in gutters and diverted to the 55,000L fish pond. The top 200mm of the pond is used as a buffer storage for short term storage and treatment purposes.
* **INDIRECT RAIN HARVESTING** I have installed a substantial stormwater piping system which is designed to capture and direct all rain which falls to ground within my house block and direct it to my storm water sump. An automated pump then transfers that water to my grey water sump which in turn automatically transfers the water to be treated by the treatment system.
* **IRRIGATION, WASHDOWN RUNNOFF HARVESTING** My shadehouse, garden areas and concrete areas have been designed to drain into my stormwater system which is retreated.
* **GREY WATER HARVESTING** I intercept grey water from my bathroom and laundry to be treated. Any excess which cannot be handled by treatment (or if power or system fails) flows to sewer as originally intended.
* **SOLIDS REMOVAL FILTRATE HARVESTING** Treatment and filtration produces high nutient solids waste which is filtered and removed to compost heaps for later garden and lawn use OR pumped to sewer if not able to handle the quantity produced.

## Activated Sludge
Activated Sludge tertiary treatment is a very effective way to treat grey water, solids waste filtrate and other input streams described above. It is a biological process requiring a very small input of energy (pumping and oxygenation) and is relatively low maintenance if well designed. Treatment relies on an adequate detention time where input effluent streams are exposed to biological processes.

## Reed Bed
Tertiary treated effluent is passed through a Secondary Treatment comprising a Constructed Reed Bed and a Gravel bio-filter to allow further biological processes and to settle out solids plus another shallow channel where treated water is exposed to natural UV. Water then passes into the pond where 75% of the surface is covered in floating rafts house reeds and other aquatic plants with roots trailing into the water.

## Slow Sand Filtration
As treated water accumulates in the buffer storage in the pond and the treated water storage tanks a decision is made to allow the water to circulate further OR transfer to the main storage tank. All water in the treated water tanks has been passed through the Slow Sand Filter. Slow sand filters work through the formation of a gelatinous layer (or biofilm) called the hypogeal layer or Schmutzdecke in the top few millimetres of the fine sand layer [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_sand_filter). Slow sand filters are also being tested for pathogen control of nutrient solutions in hydroponic systems.
