There are three separate pond filtration streams. The pond pump has its disharge stream split 3 ways directly at the point of discharge to achieve that end. One pipe has no flow control valve and feeds a stream directly to a conventional sand filter. The two remaining flows each have flow control valves to enable the flow rate to be set, albeit coarsely. One stream flows to the Shadehouse Swirl and Bio-Filtration system and the other flows to the adjacent Pump Area Swirl and Bio-Filtration system.

## Shadehouse Swirl and Bio-Filtration
This system has a nominal flow rate of 500L/hour and uses 2x200L standard polythene drums and 1x100L trough. The input stream travels initially in a 40mm pressure pipe but enters a flooded pipe transfer system built using a combination of 90 and 150mm pipe which allows settling and contact time with a biological slime. It then enters via a swirl filter and then passes through the two bio filtration stages. The first stage is a composite of carbon filter foam and polythens mesh rolls while the second stage is carbon filter foam only. The filtrate continues (by gravity flow) to join the treated water stream as it emerges from the reed bed at the gravel bio filter. Both streams (now combined) continue on to the natural UV settling pond via a short cascade before being returned to the fish pond via another short cascade allowing some oxygen contact. 


## Pump Area Swirl and Bio-Filtration
This system has a nominal flow rate of 1000L/hour and uses 3x200L polythene drums. The input stream enters via the swirl filter and the passes through the two polythene swarf bio filtration stages. The filtrate returns to the fish pond via around 25 metres of upward sloping 90mm pipe where a biological slime coating has more time to contact the stream before being returned to the fish pond via a short cascade allowing some oxygen contact. 


## Pump Area Sand Filtration and Bio-Filtration
The 55,000L fish pond was once a concrete inground saltwater swimming pool. The pond pump is the original pool pump and the sand filter was the original filter. In its present configuration the pump is only ever run at the slowest speed AND the sand filter only receives approximately one third of the total discharge of the pond pump. At this lower flow the sand filter works exceptionally well with quite high sediment loads from the fish waste (aquaponic solution?) stream. 

After leaving the sand pump the filtrate is split into two streams. One travels directly to the original pool filter return Jets and the other is sent via a 15m 90mm pipe for a little more biological slime contact time before being returned to the fish pond via a short cascade allowing some oxygen contact.
