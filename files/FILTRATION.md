There are three separate pond filtration streams. The pond pump has its disharge pipe split 3 ways directly at the point of discharge to achieve that end. One pipe has no flow control valve and feeds a stream directly to a conventional sand filter. The two remaining flows each have flow control valves to enable the flow rate to be set, albeit coarsely. One stream flows to the Shadehouse Swirl and Bio-Filtration and the other flows to the adjacent Pump Area Swirl and Bio-Filtration.
