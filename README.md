<h1 align="center"> Home-Assistant Project</h1>
<h3 align="left">A place to record my progress in providing for my need for reliable local and remote control and monitoring from myScada to Home-Assistant</h3>
<p align="left">
  I live in Australia <img src="https://github.com/oxguy3/flags/blob/master/mini/au.png"/> in the SE Qld region (about) half way between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. </p>
<p align="left">Many years ago I started automating the watering of my Shadehouse for my hobby of growing Orchids. Originally I was using very simple relay logic with no remote 
monitoring or control capability.</p>
<p align="left"> Through necessity things progressed to start utilizing Eaton Mini PLC's - https://www.eaton.com/SEAsia/ProductsSolutions/Electrical/ProductsServices/AutomationControl/Automation/ModularProgrammableLogicControllers/index.htm with a simple LED Mimic Panel which I divised to allow an operator (the wife or kids) to diagnose system status and faults for me.</p> 
<p align="left">Later I moved on to Rievtech PLC's - https://www.rievtech.com which were purchased from the wonderful Australian supplier Thomas who can be contacted here - http://www.xlogic.com.au/.</p> 
<p align="left">These PLC's were equipped with with Ethernet connectivity using the Modbus Protocol to enable a Scada system (I chose myScada - https://www.myscada.org/en/ ) to connect either locally or remotely allowing control and monitoring of my shadehouse. This was vitally necessary as I worked as a construction electrician working remotely across Australia on a FIFO roster.</p>
<p align="left">During periods of drought the lack of water required the need for treatment of grey water for supplementing rainwater and the number of PLC's and expansion's grew with the need for more and more I/O to control that system.</p> 
<p align="left">Things progressed again with the addition of a Photovoltaic Solar system with the need to monitor power becoming more important for me.</p>
<h3 align="left">Leaving myScada</h3>
<p align="left">Initially myScada was an emerging system which was still in Beta Development and they offered unlimited 'tags' and PLC connections. As time went by they also developed iOS and Android apps which in the early days were quite good and relatively bug free and included quite good technical help for free.</p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately they changed to a very expensive platform with the arrival of version 6 which at the time I chose to pay for a 500 tag unlimited connection version....to be blunt that was possibly the worst mistake I ever made. However I persisted through several years of bug ridden beta updates with zero help hoping they would get better until I realized I might be able to make a new start with Home-Assistant product.</p>
