# Home-Assistant Project

## This is a place to document my progress with moving from mySCADA to Home-Assistant the aim being to provide for a more reliable means of local, remote control and monitoring of my existing home systems

## Background

Several decades ago I started automating the watering of my shadehouse for my hobby of growing Australian native plants (including orchids). I was using very simple 12volt relay logic and some modified 240V programmable timers with no remote monitoring or control capability. At that time we lived in a remote location with no mains power. Our only means of 'always on' power being an 84W 12V solar system with 1000 amp/hour battery storage.
Leaving the bush for our new home in the city things progressed to start utilizing [Eaton Mini PLC's](https://www.eaton.com/SEAsia/ProductsSolutions/Electrical/ProductsServices/AutomationControl/Automation/ModularProgrammableLogicControllers/index.htm) with a simple LED Mimic Panel which I divised to allow an operator (the wife or kids) to diagnose system status and faults for me usually in conjunction with phone calls at night.
