  I live in Australia <img src="https://github.com/oxguy3/flags/blob/master/mini/au.png"/> in the SE Qld region (about) half way between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. </p>
<p align="left">Many years ago I started automating the watering of my Shadehouse for my hobby of growing Orchids. Originally I was using very simple relay logic with no remote 
monitoring or control capability.</p>
<p align="left"> Through necessity things progressed to start utilizing Eaton Mini PLC's with a simple LED Mimic Panel to allow an operator to diagnose sysem status and fualts 
and then on to X-Logic PLC's with Modbus and a Scada system to enable remote control and monitoring. This was necessary as I worked as a construction electrician working remotely across Australia on a FIFO roster.</p>
